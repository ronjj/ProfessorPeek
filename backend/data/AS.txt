Title: Milstein Junior Project
Description: Milstein Scholars undertake a year-long, independent study to deepen their understanding of the issues, topics, and technologies that interest them. What form these projects take -- research essay, video art, app development, etc. -- is up to the Scholar and their collaborators. Working with a faculty mentor in the field, juniors define and scope their projects in the fall and execute in the spring semester. This course culminates with the Milstein Expo in May.
