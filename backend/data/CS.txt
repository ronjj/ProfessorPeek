The area has deep connections to many aspects of theoretical computer science, including complexity theory and hardness of approximation, coding theory, cryptography and quantum computing. Topics covered will include the PCP theorem, interactive proofs, zero knowledge, succinct arguments, and quantum proof systems.

Title: Analysis of Algorithms
Description: Methodology for developing and analyzing efficient algorithms. Understanding the inherent complexity of natural problems via polynomial-time algorithms, advanced data structures, randomized algorithms, approximation algorithms, and NP-completeness. Additional topics may include algebraic and number theoretic algorithms, circuit lower bounds, online algorithms, or algorithmic game theory.

Title: Modern Prediction Paradigms: Responsible Machine Learning
Description: Predictive algorithms influence and shape society. The use of machine learning to make predictions about people raises a host of basic questions: What does it mean for a predictive algorithm to be fair to individuals from marginalized groups? On what basis should we deem a predictive algorithm to be valid? And when should we trust (or distrust) a predictor's output? This course surveys recent developments in the theory of responsible machine learning. We overview new paradigms for formulating learning problems and highlight key algorithmic tools in the study of fairness, validity, and robustness. Topics covered include: Multicalibration and Outcome Indistinguishability, Omniprediction, Performative Prediction, Distributional Robustness, and Verification of Learning.

Title: Cryptography
Description: A rigorous introduction to the theoretical foundations of the cryptography that powers much of the modern world. As this is a theoretical class, the emphasis will be on formal definitions and proofs. E.g., what does it mean to communicate securely? Can I prove that I am who I claim to be without revealing additional information (such as information that allows others to impersonate me)?

Title: Algorithmic Game Theory
Description: Algorithmic Game Theory combines algorithmic thinking with game-theoretic, or more generally, economic concepts. Designing and analyzing large-scale multi-user systems and as well as such markets, requires good understanding of tools from algorithms, game theory, and graph theory. The course will develop mathematically sophisticated techniques at the interface between algorithms and game theory, and will consider their applications to markets, auctions, networks, as well as the Internet.
