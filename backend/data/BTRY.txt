Title: Linear Models with Matrices
Description: The focus of this course is the theory and application of the general linear model expressed in its matrix form. Topics will include: least squares estimation, multiple linear regression, coding for categorical predictors, residual diagnostics, anova decomposition, polynomial regression, model selection techniques, random effects and mixed models, maximum likelihood estimation and distributional theory assuming normal errors. Homework assignments will involve computation using the R statistical package.

Code: BTRY 4090
Title: Theory of Statistics
Description: Introduction to classical theory of parametric statistical inference that builds on the material covered in BTRY 3080. Topics include: sampling distributions, principles of data reduction, likelihood, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, interval estimation, and basic asymptotic theory.

Code: BTRY 4110
Title: Categorical Data
Description: Categorical data analysis, including logistic regression, log-linear models, stratified tables, matched pairs analysis, polytomous response, and ordinal data. Applications in biological, biomedical and social sciences.

Code: BTRY 4970
Title: Undergraduate Individual Study in Biometry and Statistics
Description: Consists of individual tutorial study selected by the faculty. Because topics usually change from year to year, this course may be repeated for credit.

Code: BTRY 4980
Title: Undergraduate Supervised Teaching
Description: Students assist in teaching a course appropriate to their previous training. Students meet with a discussion or laboratory section and regularly discuss objectives with the course instructor.

Code: BTRY 4990
Title: Undergraduate Research
Description: Permits outstanding undergraduates to carry out independent study of suitable problems under appropriate supervision. Students cannot receive both pay and credit for the same hours of work.

Code: BTRY 5010
