Title: Advanced Veterinary Anesthesiology I
Description: This course is designed to prepare house officers in the Section of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine for the American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia (ACVAA) certifying examination. It also provides continuing education for faculty and staff. The course is suitable for interns and residents training in other specialties, such as surgery, internal medicine, emergency medicine, critical care, and laboratory animal medicine, as well as graduate students with interests in applied physiology and pharmacology. It consists of a three-year cycle of topics (two semesters of anatomy and physiology - focusing on the respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological systems - and one semester each of pharmacology, equipment, monitoring, and clinical anesthesiology). Each week, a lecture (usually presented by a resident or faculty member in the Section of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, or sometimes by faculty from other sections and departments), resident-led book chapter review, or laboratory is held. An online, multiple-choice, mock ACVAA examination concludes each semester.
