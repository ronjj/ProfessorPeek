Code: QUECH 1210
Title: Elementary Quechua I
Description: 1210-1220 is an introductory sequence that allows students to develop basic fluency in Quechua, the most widely spoken indigenous language in the Americas. Students learn elements of Quechua's phonetics, vocabulary, morphology and syntax through an interactive approach and gain awareness of regional and dialectal differences. The course focuses on oral and written skills, with emphasis on tasks based on familiar contexts of use. It also introduces learners to the history, culture and geography of the Andes through exposure to cultural practices, proverbs, folklore, and artefacts of the region (e.g. textiles). Students will reflect on Quechua as an endangered language and on the significance of keeping this very popular indigenous language of Latin America alive.
