Title: Introduction to Digital Agriculture
Description: The goal of this course is to expose students to the breadth and diversity of applications of digital tools in modern agriculture with special emphasis on food production systems. We will explore and discuss the main drivers of the digital transformation in agriculture at a local and global scale. Special emphasis will be placed on the integration of basic concepts of systems biology, data science, and engineering. The socio-economic implications of deployment and utilization of digital tools will be covered. Examples of development, deployment, and post-implementation assessment of digital tools for improving the sustainability of plant and animal food production systems will be discussed. Ultimately, students will recognize the need for interdisciplinary efforts to propel the digital transformation of food production agriculture while benefiting society and the planet.

Title: Data Democratization
Description: Access to quality data and information is at the heart of an informed and engaged populace. However, the skills required to process and make sense of data have historically been disproportionately held by state and corporate actors who often possess more resources to collect, store and analyze data than everyday people. This is particularly true in the context of surveillance technology, where use of data collected from such means is not equitably distributed, or equally advantageous. Through a framework of data democratization, this class will equip students with the skills needed to critically interrogate and use authentic data from a variety of open data sources to inform their personal decisions, including civic engagement and issue advocacy.
